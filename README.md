# Automatic-Door-Opening-System
A technical project using PIR Sensor and Arduino Uno,that automatically opens and closes the door by detecting any person or object.Many automated door open systems have been developed on different platforms  which requires special hard ware devices which sense and detect  movements.Purchasing new hard ware devices is costly and more time  consuming so in this work an attempt has been made to implement a system  which is more economical and easily accessible. By this automatic door system  any sensation of movement of a person at the exact time is efficiently detected  there by making this project useful .
